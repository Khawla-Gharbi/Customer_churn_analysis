# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a retail business using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.  
A Random Forest Classifier was implemented, achieving an accuracy of ~85%.  
The project highlights feature importance and provides actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

## Features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Gender**: Whether the customer is male or female.  
- **SeniorCitizen**: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1) or not (0).

- **MonthlyCharges**: The customerâ€™s monthly bill amount.  
- **TotalCharges**: Total amount charged to the customer.  
- **Churn**: The target variable indicating whether the customer churned (Yes/No).  

## Tools & Technologies:
